The Lighthouse at Cape Morrow

Elena had been the lighthouse keeper at Cape Morrow for seventeen years. Every evening, she climbed the 142 spiral steps to the lamp room, checked the oil reserves, and polished the great Fresnel lens until it gleamed like a diamond. The ships that passed through the strait depended on her light, and she had never once let it go dark.

On the night of October 14th, the worst storm in decades struck the coast. Winds howled at 90 miles per hour, and waves crashed over the rocky peninsula. The power lines snapped at 8 PM, killing the backup generator. Elena had only the old kerosene reserves — enough for maybe four hours.

At 11 PM, she spotted a distress flare through the rain. A fishing vessel, the Santa Maria, carrying a crew of twelve, had lost its engine and was drifting toward the rocks. Elena radioed the coast guard, but static was the only reply. The radio tower had fallen.

She made a decision. She angled the lighthouse beam toward the rocks, creating a visible warning, and then grabbed her father's old signal lantern. Standing on the observation deck in the howling wind, she flashed Morse code toward the vessel: D-A-N-G-E-R  R-O-C-K-S  S-T-E-E-R  S-O-U-T-H.

The captain of the Santa Maria, old Jorge Mendes, recognized the signal. He ordered the crew to deploy the emergency sail, and they caught enough wind to steer south around the rocks into the sheltered bay.

All twelve crew members survived. When the coast guard finally arrived at dawn, they found Elena still at her post, hypothermic but alive, the kerosene lamp burned down to its last drop.

The town of Cape Morrow awarded Elena the Maritime Medal of Valor. Jorge Mendes named his next boat "The Elena." And every October 14th, the town lights lanterns along the shore in her honor.
