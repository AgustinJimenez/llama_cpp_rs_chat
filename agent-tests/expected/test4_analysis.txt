Analysis of Weather and Crop Yields Correlation\n==================================================\n\nBest and Worst Yields: The best crop yields occurred in September with 1,680 pounds per acre, while the worst yield was in July with only 340 pounds per acre.\n\nCorrelation with Weather Conditions: The data shows a clear correlation between rainfall and yield. Months with higher rainfall (May: 5.8 inches, April: 4.2 inches, September: 4.8 inches) produced significantly better yields compared to the drought month of July (0.3 inches).\n\nKey Findings:\n- High rainfall months (May, April, September) showed excellent yields (820-1680 lbs/acre)
- The July drought caused the lowest yield (340 lbs/acre) due to heat stress and lack of water
- The partial recovery in August (980 lbs/acre) shows the importance of adequate moisture for recovery\n- The strong September harvest (1680 lbs/acre) demonstrates how returning rain and cooler temperatures benefit tomato production
